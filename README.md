# 🧾 Requirements Document: Vector Database Engine

## 📌 Project Title

**VectoDB** – A High-Performance, Embedding-Aware Vector Database Engine

---

## 1. 📖 Overview

VectoDB is a custom-built vector database optimized for **similarity search on high-dimensional data** such as embeddings from LLMs, image models, or time-series signals. It emphasizes memory safety, predictable performance, and operational simplicity while supporting fast insertions, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries, metadata filtering, and robust persistence.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Memory safety without performance compromise
- Predictable query latency under load
- Simple operational model with clear failure modes
- Extensible architecture for future algorithm integration

* Store 1M+ high-dimensional vectors (128-2048 dims) efficiently
* Achieve sub-10ms p95 similarity search latency
* Support batch and streaming vector ingestion
* Provide crash-safe persistence with point-in-time recovery
* Expose clean APIs for vector CRUD and similarity search

### Secondary Goals:
* Support multiple distance metrics (cosine, dot product, Euclidean, Manhattan)
* Enable rich metadata filtering with compound queries
* Provide real-time index optimization and compaction
* Support horizontal read scaling via replicas

### Stretch Goals:
* Multi-tenant isolation with resource quotas
* Distributed sharding with automatic rebalancing
* Advanced index types (IVF+PQ, LSH, Annoy)
